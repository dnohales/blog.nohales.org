Hi people! I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to GUADEC 2015 in Gothenburg thanks to the great help of GNOME Foundation who is sponsoring a nice part of my travel expenses!

This is going to be my first GUADEC, my first time in Sweden and my first time on the other side of the Ocean. I know I'm going to have a great time with all the GNOMErs and with the Swedish culture. I'm finally going to meet Jonas, Mattias, Zeeshan and all the people who helped me to enjoy my favorite job (GSoC 2014), that's priceless.

See you in Gothenburg!
